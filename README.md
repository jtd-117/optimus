## About:
Optimus is a Chrome extension that serves as an all-in-one [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and website blocker. 

When the pomodoro timer is active, users are blocked from specific websites they have specified in the settings page. With adjustable work and rest timers, users can boost their productivity.
